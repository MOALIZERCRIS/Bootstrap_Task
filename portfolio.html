                                It became increasingly clear that speed to contact, the time it takes a company to
                                contact a lead after submitting an online form or calling in, was their edge. These
                                types of leads were often sold to several mortgage companies at the same time.
                                Statistics proved that the first company to contact the borrower back had a massive
                                advantage.

                                Baytech already had a reputation for creating successful software in the mortgage
                                industry. We previously pioneered a popup-based alert system that blasted all agents
                                with a message that a new lead was available. This improved the speed to contact
                                rate and is now the norm in the industry. The first agent to click “accept” gets the
                                lead.

                                While this was a big improvement over phone-based round robin and sufficient for
                                smaller shops, it loses its effectiveness for larger pools of agents. A larger
                                quantity of leads ends up being awarded to the fastest clickers. Those agents were
                                often the ones who were not on their phones. Unfortunately, these agents were
                                usually not the best performers.

                                In addition, the competition was starting to catch on and implement their own
                                popup-based alert systems using the Blast All approach.

                                A second problem that was occurring was cherry picking. At this time, internet leads
                                were becoming increasingly important to call centers to add to overall lead volume.
                                They were inexpensive compared to traditional mediums, like radio and tv, and could
                                include more information up front about a borrower.

                                However, agents viewed internet leads as being more difficult to work with and of a
                                lower quality than inbound calls. Borrowers were not always available to receive a
                                call back from an agent, regardless of how quick the speed to contact was. Also, a
                                borrower calling in to a bank typically had an elevated level of interest and was
                                easier to close compared to those submitting an internet form.

                                As a result, agents would ignore internet leads and only wait for inbound calls.
                                InterCap needed a way to prevent cherry picking so their marketing dollars were
                                maximized.

                                To give InterCap an edge, we tackled the issues of speed to contact and lead
                                distribution in a unique way. We did this by engineering a new Hybrid Round Robin

                                system and unified the agent experience for accepting new internet and inbound call

                                we made an agent’s place in the queue based on a score which changed based on
                                opportunities they did not win. This method, versus a serial placement, allowed the
                                system to weigh certain types of leads above others. It increased an agent’s place
                                in queue only for the leads they had the skills to close, and favored higher
                                converting agents.

                                Overall, this increased the company’s bottom line by increasing the conversation
                                rates. It also improved the agent’s morale by ensuring the leads were being
                                delivered fairly.

                                Since speed to contact was so important, we decided to pioneer another new concept,
                                which is becoming more common in CRMs today. We decided to integrate the system
                                directly with an open source IP PBX phone system called Asterisk.

                                The system automatically sent an outbound call to internet leads when it received
                                them while simultaneously contacting agents to accept the lead opportunities. When
                                an agent accepted, the system connected them to the outbound dialing call.

                                This meant there was a 0-second turn-around from when we received the lead to when
                                we dialed the lead. Due to the hybrid Round Robin, the speed to contact rate dropped
                                to under 3 seconds, on average. This was the fastest possible speed to contact for
                                internet leads and led to the highest conversions and marketing ROI.

                                Prime revamped the way agents used to receive leads in the past. The company relied on
                                either the round-robin or broadcast approach. The round-robin method involved contacting
                                agents one at a time until someone responded, while the broadcast method caused
                                everyone’s phone to ring at once. With an average of 100 agents on the floor at any
                                given time, broadcasting calls to everyone at once caused the workplace to be noisy and
                                distracting. Using the Round Robin method made the borrower wait too long while it was
                                finding an agent. Both ways proved to be inefficient when used individually.

                                The new hybrid model combined the best of both worlds. Five agents get an instant
                                notification when a lead enters the system. Prime delivers the lead to the most
                                effective agents based on their skills and past level of success. The assignment of the
                                lead kicks off a custom workflow. It contains specific requirements for the agent when
                                it comes to customer interactions and system updates based on the source.

                                five agents instead of sending the lead to everyone.
